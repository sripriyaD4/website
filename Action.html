            <h2 style="color:rgb(54, 9, 152);">Short Term Action Plan:
</h1><p style="font-size:120%;">Our short term goal is to mainly focus on the nutritional requirements of children especially the younger ones as the food intake they take today completely provides them with an overall good health and helps in their growth, mental state and antifragileness .Awareness camps can also be held about the Nutrition food for the students who have no idea about it. Choose a diet made of nutrient-rich foods. Nutrient-rich (or nutrient-dense) foods are low in sugar, sodium, starches, and bad fats. They contain a lot of vitamins and minerals and few calories. Your body needs vitamins and minerals, known as micro nutrients.</p>
